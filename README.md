# The Vide Video Project

This project was created as part of the necessary requirements for completion of the JavaScript React September 2018 Class offered by Code Louisville.<br>
For now, it is just a simple prototype of a movie rental service where you can browse movies fetched from the "The Movie Database API", add them to the cart and "rent" them if they are available.
At the moment, there are some bugs that (I hope) will be squashed in the future, when I get more comfortable using React.
When I compare this project to the Front-End project I submitted four months ago, in which I had barely two JavaScript functions written, I see how much I learned from this class.

Please, download the repo associated with this project to your computer, run `npm i` to install it and from the project directory, run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.
In the project directory, you can run:

### Endpoints used in the project:

### [Search Movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies)

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [Search Movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
